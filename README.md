# Pricing problems with Thompson Sampling

Abstract:

In 1933, William R. Thompson proposed an algorithm known as Thompson sampling in order to maximise culmulative payoff in a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem. MAB problems have been frequently used to model real-life decision making scenarios. This paper explores the extension of Thompson sampling to other problems beyond the MAB setting. More specifically, Thompson sampling is applied to product sales using data from a real dataset in a dynamic pricing setting as part of the multi-product pricing problem.
