Title: Pricing problems with Thompson sampling

Description of project:

In recent years, many customers have been turning to e-commerce instead of brick and mortar shops due to reasons such as better deals and convenience. In order to gain maximum profits, a seller’s pricing decision needs to take customers’ heterogeneous purchase behaviour into account. One recent stream of modelling the pricing problem is to map the pricing problem to a multi-armed bandit problem, which allows application of some existing algorithms to solve the pricing problem by learning demand from historical data and pricing decisions, without knowing any future information. Among those algorithms, Thompson sampling is recently recognized as an efficient algorithm. This project is about applying Thompson sampling to online pricing problems with customers’ heterogeneous choice behaviour. This project can be broken down into two parts: 

1) To understand customer demand, customer segmentation will be done using unsupervised machine learning methods to group them into different categories.

2) From the results of segmentation, Thompson sampling can be done for each customer type to make pricing decisions under some inventory constraints, where the inventory constraints come from the allocation of total inventory to different categories of customers.
